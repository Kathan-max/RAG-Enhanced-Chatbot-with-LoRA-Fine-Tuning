# RAG-Enhanced-Chatbot-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning

## 📌 Overview

**RAG-Enhanced-Chatbot-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that leverages external knowledge sources and enhances generation quality using LoRA fine-tuning. It enables efficient domain-specific adaptation of large language models while combining it with semantic search for grounded, accurate, and context-rich responses.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines document retrieval with generative responses for factual accuracy.
- 🧠 **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models with low resource requirements.
- 📄 **Multi-Format Document Ingestion:** Supports PDFs, text files, and scanned documents (via OCR).
- ⚙️ **Modular Pipeline:** Separates data ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and generation for flexibility.
- 🌐 **Custom Knowledge Base:** Tailor your chatbot to domain-specific knowledge.
