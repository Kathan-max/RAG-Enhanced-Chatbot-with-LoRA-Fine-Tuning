# RAG-Enhanced-Chatbot-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning

## 📌 Overview

**RAG-Enhanced-Chatbot-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that leverages external knowledge sources and enhances generation quality using LoRA fine-tuning. It enables efficient domain-specific adaptation of large language models while combining it with semantic search for grounded, accurate, and context-rich responses.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines document retrieval with generative responses for factual accuracy.
- 🧠 **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models with low resource requirements.
- 📄 **Multi-Format Document Ingestion:** Supports PDFs, text files, and scanned documents (via OCR).
- ⚙️ **Modular Pipeline:** Separates data ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and generation for flexibility.
- 🌐 **Custom Knowledge Base:** Tailor your chatbot to domain-specific knowledge.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language Models:** Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen2.5VL-7B, etc.)
- **Vector Database:** FAISS / Pinecone / Chroma
- **Embeddings:** OpenAI / Hugging Face Embedding APIs
- **Fine-Tuning:** LoRA (via `peft`)
- **Backend:** Python
- **Parsing Tools:** PyMuPDF, pdfminer, pytesseract

## 🧪 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-Enhanced-Chatbot-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning.git
   cd RAG-Enhanced-Chatbot-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your documents** in the `/data_ingestion/` directory.

4. **Run the ingestion pipeline** to chunk and embed your documents.

5. **Launch the chatbot** (with or without an API/UI) and start chatting!

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for LoRA fine-tuning)
- Sufficient storage for vector embeddings and model weights

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Before running the project, configure the following:

- Set your API keys for embedding services (OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- Choose your preferred vector database (FAISS for local, Pinecone/Chroma for cloud)
- Select the base language model for fine-tuning
- Adjust chunking parameters based on your document types
