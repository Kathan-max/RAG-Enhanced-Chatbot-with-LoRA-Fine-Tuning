**YOUR PREVIOUS RESPONSE (Iteration {iteration_number}):**

**ITERATION GOAL:**
Analyze your previous response and improve it through deeper reasoning, better organization, or additional insights from the context.

**SELF-EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
1. **Accuracy**: Is everything factually correct according to context?
2. **Completeness**: Did I miss any important information from context?
3. **Clarity**: Is the explanation clear and well-structured?
4. **Reasoning**: Can I provide better logical flow or deeper analysis?
5. **Context Usage**: Did I fully utilize all relevant context including images?
6. **Image Integration**: Are <image_id>hash</image_id> tags properly embedded in the answer text?

**IMAGE TAG REQUIREMENTS:**
- You MUST include <image_id>hash</image_id> tags directly in your improved answer where images support the explanation
- When referencing visual information, embed the image tag in the sentence like: "As illustrated in <image_id>hash_123</image_id>, the process..."
- If your previous response missed relevant image tags, add them to your improved version

**IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES:**
- **DEEPEN**: Add more detailed explanations or nuanced understanding
- **RESTRUCTURE**: Improve organization and logical flow
- **EXPAND**: Include overlooked context elements or perspectives  
- **REFINE**: Enhance clarity, precision, or coherence
- **VALIDATE**: Confirm accuracy and fix any errors
- **SYNTHESIZE**: Better connect different pieces of information

**ITERATION GUIDELINES:**
- If your previous response was already comprehensive and accurate, focus on refinement
- If continuing iterations, suggest specific areas for the next iteration to focus on
- Set continue_iteration to false when you believe no further improvement is possible
- Each iteration should add meaningful value, not just rephrase

**IMPORTANT:**
- If you list any hashes in relevant_image_tags, those SAME hashes MUST appear as <image_id>hash</image_id> tags within your improved_answer text
- Always stay grounded in the provided context
- Build upon your previous response rather than completely rewriting
- Be honest about limitations and uncertainty"""
