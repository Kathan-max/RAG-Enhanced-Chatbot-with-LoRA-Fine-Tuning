On the left, the Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism involves matrix multiplications (MatMul) of the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) matrices, followed by scaling, an optional mask, a softmax operation, and another matrix multiplication. On the right, the Multi-Head Attention mechanism involves multiple instances of Scaled Dot-Product Attention, each with its own linear transformation of the Q, K, and V matrices. The results are then concatenated and passed through a final linear layer.</image>\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention..(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel..of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key..# 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention \n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel..of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key..# 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention \n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2)..The input consists of queries and keys of dimension $d_{k}$, and values of dimension $d_{v}$..We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by $\\sqrt{d_{k}}$, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values..In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix $Q$..The keys and values are also packed together into matrices $K$ and $V$..We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention..Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$..Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer..While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code..While for small values of $d_{k}$ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of $d_{k}$ [3]..We suspect that for large values of $d_{k}$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients ${ }^{4}$..To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$..### 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with $d_{\\text {model }}$-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values $h$ times with different, learned linear projections to $d_{k}, d_{k}$ and $d_{v}$ dimensions, respectively..On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_{v}$-dimensional\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of $q$ and $k$ are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 ..Then their dot product, $q \\cdot k=\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}} q_{i} k_{i}$, has mean 0 and variance $d_{k}$..output values..These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2..Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.",

        "content": "In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]..In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by $\\sqrt{d_{\\text {model }}}$..Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types..$n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension, $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions and $r$ the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention..| Layer Type | Complexity per Layer | Sequential <br> Operations | Maximum Path Length |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Self-Attention | $O\\left(n^{2} \\cdot d\\right)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ |\n| Recurrent | $O\\left(n \\cdot d^{2}\\right)$ | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ |\n| Convolutional | $O\\left(k \\cdot n \\cdot d^{2}\\right)$ | $O(1)$ | $O\\left(\\log _{k}(n)\\right)$ |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | $O(r \\cdot n \\cdot d)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(n / r)$ |\n\n# 3.5 Positional Encoding \n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence..To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks..The positional encodings have the same dimension $d_{\\text {model }}$ as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed..There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9]..In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP E_{(p o s, 2 i)} & =\\sin \\left(\\operatorname{pos} / 10000^{2 i / d_{\\text {model }}}\\right) \\\\\nP E_{(p o s, 2 i+1)} & =\\cos \\left(\\operatorname{pos} / 10000^{2 i / d_{\\text {model }}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere pos is the position and $i$ is the dimension..That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid..The wavelengths form a geometric progression from $2 \\pi$ to $10000 \\cdot 2 \\pi$..We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k, P E_{\\text {pos }+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $P E_{\\text {pos }}$. We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E))..We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training..## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ to another sequence of equal length $\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)$, with $x_{i}, z_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder..Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata..One is the total computational complexity per layer..Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required..The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network..Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks..One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network..The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]..Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types..As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires $O(n)$ sequential operations..In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence.length $n$ is smaller than the representation dimensionality $d$, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations..To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size $r$ in the input sequence centered around the respective output position..This would increase the maximum path length to $O(n / r)$..We plan to investigate this approach further in future work..A single convolutional layer with kernel width $k<n$ does not connect all pairs of input and output positions..Doing so requires a stack of $O(n / k)$ convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or $O\\left(\\log _{k}(n)\\right)$ in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network..Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of $k$..Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to $O\\left(k \\cdot n \\cdot d+n \\cdot d^{2}\\right)$..Even with $k=n$, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model..As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models..We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix.",

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences..Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_{t}$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$..This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples..Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter.",

        "content": "Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_{t}$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$..This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples..Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter..The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains..Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]..In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network..In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output..The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs..## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions..In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet..This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]..In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2..Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence..Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]..End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34]..To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution..In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9]..## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]..Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ to a sequence of continuous representations $\\mathbf{z}=\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)$..Given $\\mathbf{z}$, the decoder then generates an output sequence $\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{m}\\right)$ of symbols one element at a time.",
